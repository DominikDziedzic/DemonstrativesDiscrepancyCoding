# Demonstratives: Discrepancy Coding Procedure
Repository for storing supplementary materials and data to accompany "TODO: TITLE" (2022). Part of [**Demonstratives: Main Study**](https://github.com/DominikDziedzic/DemonstrativesMain) repository.

The results of the Discrepancy Coding Procedure are presented and discussed. The Procedure is a part of Demonstratives: Main Study. The task discussed in the Main Study was the following: a sample of scenarios, in which utterances of ordinary demonstrative sentences are made, was presented to participants; each sentence was presented as either true or false in the described context. The study aimed to measure participantsâ€™ subjective beliefs regarding the nature of the stimuli and the effectiveness of experimental manipulation. The sample in the Main Study consists of TODO: NUMBER scenarios. However, the initial sample consisted of 26 scenarios. 

This repository is concerned primarily with the results of the following coding task: a team of 8 professional philosophers (4 Ph.D.'s and 4 Ph.D. candidates with interest in semantics and indexicality in particular; excluding the author of the current study) categorized the stimuli into two categories:
- **Possible discrepancy [+_d_] between actual demonstration and intended referent**,
- **No discrepancy [-_d_] between actual demonstration and intended referent**.
