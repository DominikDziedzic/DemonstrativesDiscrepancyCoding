# Demonstratives: Discrepancy Coding Procedure
Repository for storing supplementary materials and data to accompany "TITLE Under Construction" (2022). Part of Demonstratives: Main Study repository.

The results of the Discrepancy Coding Procedure are presented and discussed. The Procedure is a part of Demonstratives: Main Study. The task discussed in the Main Study was the following: a sample of scenarios, in which utterances of ordinary demonstrative sentences are made, was presented to participants; each sentence was presented as either true or false in the described context. The study aimed to measure participantsâ€™ subjective beliefs regarding the nature of the stimuli and the effectiveness of experimental manipulation. The sample in the Main Study consists of N(number) scenarios. However, the initial sample consisted of 26 scenarios. 

This repository is concerned primarily with the results of the following coding task: a team of 8 professional philosophers (4 Ph.D.'s and 4 Ph.D. candidates with interest in semantics and indexicality in particular; excluding the author of the current study) categorized the stimuli into two categories:
- **Possible discrepancy [+d] between actual demonstration and intended referent**,
- **No discrepancy [-d] between actual demonstration and intended referent**.
